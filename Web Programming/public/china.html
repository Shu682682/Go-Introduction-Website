        <h3>China Go</h3>
        <p>
          On March 15, 1992, the founding ceremony of the China Chess Academy was held grandly. The Chinese Chess Academy broke ground in October 1988 and took more than three years to finally complete. The Chinese Chess Academy is a public institution directly under the National Sports Commission. It is a comprehensive training base and competition venue for Chinese chess sports. It directly manages the national team training tasks for the national Go team, chess and international chess, and undertakes various domestic and international competitions for the three chess games. Major competitions, and various mass chess and card activities are also carried out.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November 2019, the Chess and Card Sports Management Center of the State Sports General Administration (China Chess Academy) was awarded the protection unit of the national intangible cultural heritage representative project "Xiangqi".
