        <h3>What is Go</h3>
        <p>
          According to legend, Go was invented by Emperor Yao around 2300 BC. His son Danzhu was proud, arrogant, and willful, so Emperor Yao invented Go to cultivate his son's character.

          Go has two kinds of chess pieces, black and white. It is stipulated that the player holding the black chess piece goes first. Both sides of the game alternately place black and white chess pieces at the intersection points on the 19x19 line chessboard grid. After the move is completed, you cannot regret the move. During the game of chess, the size of the surrounding "land" determines the outcome.

        <h3>New Go Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          After the Meiji Restoration, shogi players lost the support of the shogunate and began to seek new means of livelihood, which led to the emergence of news chess games and the modern ranking system, and the establishment of a nationwide Japanese chess academy. During the Showa era, Wu Qingyuan and Kitani Minoru jointly set off the trend of "new layout" and began the era of modern Go. Later, many first-class chess players emerged in the Japanese chess world, such as Eio Sakata, Hideyuki Fujisawa, Katsura Takagawa, and later Hideo Otake, Yoshio Ishida, Masaki Takemiya, Koichi Kobayashi, etc.        </p>

          In 1989, South Korean Cho Hoon-hyun won the first Yingshi Cup World Go Championship, which also triggered a boom in Go in South Korea. Since then, a large number of world chess games have appeared. In these chess battles, South Korea's Lee Chang-ho stood out from many chess players and became the number one player in the chess world at that time. After 2006, Lee Chang-ho's status declined, and emerging forces such as Lee Sedol and Gu Li began to attack him. The next few years were the era of the two heroes Gu Li and Li Shidou competing for hegemony.
