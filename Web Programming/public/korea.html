          The Korean Chess Academy (Korean: 한국기원) is the governing body of Korean professional Go. Its history can be traced back to the Seoul Chess Academy founded by Cho Nan-chul in November 1945.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1937, Zhao Nanzhe went to Japan to study under the 9th Dan chess master Minu Kitani. In 1945, he returned to China and founded the Chess Academy. Koreans traditionally open the game with the patrol method. After opening the Korean Chess Academy, Cho convinced Koreans to open the game with a white board.
           In 1956, he founded the National Players Tournament to promote Go competition among the people.

          <h4> Cho Nam-cheol</h4>
          <h5>
            Cho Nam-cheol (Korean: 조남철, November 30, 1923 - July 2, 2006) was a Korean Go professional ninth-dan player and the father of modern Korean Go.
          </h5>
          <p>
            In 1946, Zhao Nanzhe founded the Seoul Chess Academy, and Korean professional Go officially appeared. In 1950, under the organization of Zhao Nanzhe, South Korea held the first modern Go sectional competition. Zhao was designated as the third dan and the others were designated as the first dan.
             In 1955, Zhao persuaded South Korean President Syngman Rhee to organize a delegation of professional chess players to go to Taiwan to compete in an international match with local Go players and win. This victory boosted the low morale of the Korean people and made Zhao and Hyundai Go famous. Soon, professional chess tournaments in Korea were established one after another, and the Seoul Chess Academy was rebuilt in 1968 and renamed the Korean Chess Academy.
             Cho himself dominated the Korean chess world for a long time after the 1950s, until his junior chess player Kim In returned from studying in Japan and lost his dominance. He was awarded ninth-dan in 1983 and entered the national chess tournament in 1994, becoming the oldest chess player to enter the professional chess tournament. With his support, his nephew Zhao Zhixun went to Japan to study and later became the number one player in the Japanese chess world.

          <h4>Cho Hoon-hyun</h4>
          <h5>
            Cho Hoon-hyun (조훈현, born March 10, 1953), a famous Korean Go player, a professional ninth-dan player at the Korean Chess Academy, a nine-time world champion, the first generation founder of modern Go in Korea, and is revered as the "Emperor of Go".
          </h5>
          <p>
            Cho Hoon-hyun is the master of Lee Chang-ho, the Go world champion record holder, and is known as the "Master and Disciple of Cho Lee"; together with Liu Chang-hyuk and Seo Bong-soo, the two are known as the "Four Kings of Korea". The four of them dominated world chess from the 1990s to the mid-2000s. The altar initiated absolute rule.
             Cho was born in Mokpo City, South Jeolla Province. He entered Dan in 1962 and became the youngest professional chess player in the history of the Korean Chess Academy (9 years and 7 months old). In 1963, Cao went to Japan to learn chess and became a disciple of Kensaku Segoe. He entered Dan again in Japan and was recognized as fifth dan by the Japanese Chess Academy in 1972. After returning to China due to military service, he stayed in South Korea to develop, and met with famous amateur chess players and Korean chess players. Gambling king Cha Min-soo has a close friendship in the military. After being discharged from the army, he was originally scheduled to return to Japan, but he chose to stay after encountering fierce confrontation with Seo Bong-soo 9th Dan. Later, Cho Hun-hyun won the many-year competition with Seo Bong-soo and became the overlord of the Korean chess world. He has won more than 130 domestic chess championships in Korea and was promoted to 9th Dan in 1982. In 1989, Cao defeated the Chinese chess master Nie Weiping 9th Dan 3-2 in the first Yingshi Cup and won the championship, setting off a Go boom in Korea and becoming a Korean national hero.

          <h4> Lee Chang-ho</h4>
          <h5>
            Lee Chang-ho (Korean: 이창호, born on July 29, 1975) is a Go player born in Jeonju City, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea. The second generation master of Korean Go is the greatest chess player in the history of modern Go after Wu Qingyuan, or "Go in the 20th century, with Wu Qingyuan before him and Lee Chang-ho after him."
          </h5>
          <p>
            He entered Dan in 1986 at the age of 11, second only to Cho Hun-hyun who entered the 9th Dan at the age of 9. He won the world championship in 1992 under the age of 16 years and 6 months, and is still the youngest person to win the world Go championship. In 1996, the Korean Chess Academy specially allowed him and Liu Changhyuk to be promoted from seventh-dan to ninth-dan. He has won all Korean domestic championships and the World Chess Grand Slam. His active period in the international chess world was from 1992 to 2012, and the period from 1996 to 2006 was recognized as the "Lee Chang-ho era" in the chess world.
             He has won 17 world championships and 21 international championships in his career, and he still ranks first in the world. Lee Chang-ho is not only the king of the individual competition, but also the hero of the team competition. With his unwavering willpower, he achieved 14 consecutive victories in the Three Kingdoms Arena and ended the game 9 times with a total score of 29 wins and 7 losses. He was praised by Korean chess fans as " "Guardian Saint" and Chinese and Japanese chess fans despairingly called it the "Iron Gate."
          </p>
          <p>
            Lee Chang-ho, Cho Hoon-hyun, Seo Bong-soo, and Yoo Chang-hyuk are known as South Korea's "four great kings." Together with Lee Sedol, Park Young-hun and Choi Cheol-han, they are known as the "New Four Heavenly Kings". Because their age, name pronunciation, and domestic record are similar to those of China's Chang Hao 9th Dan, the two are called the "peerless twins." However, both in terms of international performance and battle records, Chang Hao is far inferior.
