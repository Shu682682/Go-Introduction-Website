        <h3>Taiwan Go Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In 1986, based on his love for Go, Mr. Lin Wenbo decided to donate 30 million yuan to establish a foundation with the purpose of promoting Go.
           After consulting national player Lin Haifeng for his opinions, he received his full support and promised to serve as the first chairman. The "Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation" was established and launched the mission of promoting Go.
           Since holding professional and amateur competitions requires a large investment of money and manpower, the Haifeng Foundation has been donated by Chairman Lin Wenbo for many years and has grown rapidly. However, it is still not enough to hold professional competitions. Therefore, there is a need for organizational adjustments. Lin The chairman decided to merge the "Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation" into the "Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation" so that one plus one can be more effective than two.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation is another consortium donated by Chairman Lin Wenbo and other families, and has been engaged in special education work. Since the funds are more abundant than the Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation, after the "Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation" was merged into the "Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation", the Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation retired and the stick of promoting chess was handed over to the "Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation" meeting". In order to meet the needs of Go work, the original staff of the Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation also made adjustments and was reorganized into the "Haifeng Chess Academy" to continue working on the front line to promote Go.
